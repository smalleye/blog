### Applicability: Taylor Series vs. Fourier Series

Both Taylor and Fourier series are powerful mathematical tools used for approximating functions, but they are applicable in different contexts and have distinct characteristics.

---

### 1. **Taylor Series:**
   - **Definition**: The Taylor series represents a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point.
   - **Form**:
     \\[
     f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x - a)^n
     \\]
     where \\( f^{(n)}(a) \\) is the \\( n \\)-th derivative of \\( f \\) evaluated at \\( x = a \\).

   - **Applicability**:
     - **Local Approximation**: 
       - Taylor series provide a local approximation of a function around a point \\( a \\).
       - Best suited for functions that are smooth (infinitely differentiable) and analytic within a certain interval around the expansion point.
     - **Convergence**: 
       - Converges well near the point \\( a \\), but may diverge or provide poor approximation further away, especially if the function has singularities or is not analytic over the whole domain.
     - **Real-valued Functions**: 
       - Generally used for real-valued functions in various domains like physics, engineering, and economics.
     - **Non-Periodic Functions**: 
       - Taylor series are typically applied to non-periodic functions or in cases where a localized expansion is required.

### 2. **Fourier Series:**
   - **Definition**: The Fourier series represents a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines (or complex exponentials).
   - **Form** (Complex):
     \\[
     f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{i\frac{2\pi n x}{T}}
     \\]
     where \\( c_n \\) are the complex Fourier coefficients.

   - **Applicability**:
     - **Global Approximation**: 
       - Fourier series provide a global approximation of a function over its entire domain.
     - **Periodic Functions**: 
       - Specifically designed for periodic functions. Any periodic function with period \\( T \\) can be expressed as a Fourier series.
     - **Piecewise Continuous Functions**: 
       - Can handle functions that are not smooth, including piecewise continuous functions and those with discontinuities.
       - Captures discontinuities with the Gibbs phenomenon.
     - **Convergence**: 
       - Converges in the sense of mean square (LÂ² norm) for functions that are square-integrable over a period, even if they are not differentiable.
     - **Widely Used in Signal Processing**: 
       - Essential in fields like signal processing, communications, and physics, where periodic signals are analyzed.
